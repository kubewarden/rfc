# Summary
[summary]: #summary

<!---
Brief (one-paragraph) explanation of the feature.
--->

First RFC, which doubles as a template.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

<!---
- Why are we doing this?
- What use cases does it support?
- What is the expected outcome?

Describe the problem you are trying to solve, and its constraints, without
coupling them too closely to the solution you have in mind. If this RFC is not
accepted, the motivation can be used to develop alternative solutions.
--->

RFCs are a tool for achieving consensus, alignment, and documenting it for
reference. 

When developing complex features that touch different parts of Kubewarden, it is
useful to have consensus on what the feature entails, its pros and cons, and how
the implementation will be achieved.

## Examples / User Stories
[examples]: #examples

<!---
Examples of how the feature will be used. Interactions should show the action
and the response. When appropriate, provide user stories in the form of "As a
[role], I want [feature], so [that]."
--->

See other RFCs.

# Detailed design
[design]: #detailed-design

<!---
This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody
familiar with the product to understand, and for somebody familiar with the
internals to implement.

This section should cover architecture aspects and the rationale behind
disruptive technical decisions (when applicable), as well as corner-cases and
warnings.
--->

Adapt this template into a new RFC and open a PR against this repo.

An RFC is created with `ACCEPTED` as state. After discussion and adapting, if it
merges, it is merged as `ACCEPTED`. If it is finally rejected or consensus is
not reached, it is changed to `REJECTED` and merged.

States:
- `ACCEPTED`: Consensus exists on what to be done and how. Silence is not
  agreement but unanimity is not needed either.
- `REJECTED`: No consensus either for the proposal or the implementation.


# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

<!---
Why should we **not** do this?

  * obscure corner cases
  * will it impact performance?
  * what other parts of the product will be affected?
  * will the solution be hard to maintain in the future?
--->

# Alternatives
[alternatives]: #alternatives

<!---
- What other designs/options have been considered?
- What is the impact of not doing this?
--->

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved]: #unresolved-questions

<!---
- What are the unknowns?
- What can happen if Murphy's law holds true?
