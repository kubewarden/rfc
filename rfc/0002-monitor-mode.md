# Summary
[summary]: #summary

> Brief (one-paragraph) explanation of the feature.

The monitor mode will improve the visibility of a cluster administrator with regards to policies and
how they act. It will enable the cluster administrator to understand the consequences of fully
activating a policy before it starts to reject requests.

Currently, Policies are deployed and become active immediately -- accepting, mutating or rejecting
requests.

With this context, as a cluster administrator it is not easy to understand the consequences of
deploying new policies in a running cluster. This RFC works on the strategy to improve this
situation and let the administrator gain visibility before policies are truly enforced in the
cluster.

Introduce a monitor mode in Kubewarden that acts in the following way:

1. Deploy policies without rejecting or mutating requests, so actions that would have been taken had
   the policy been active are logged. We will call this method "monitor"  mode, because it lets
   the cluster operator understand if a policy in this mode would be rejecting requests that impact
   the regular functionality of the cluster.

## Examples / User Stories

As a Kubernetes administrator I want to deploy new policies in a state that they don't perform any
request rejections, but only inform about what would have been rejected had the policy been active.

As a Kubernetes administrator I want to deploy new policies in "monitor" mode, and then flip the
switch of the policy to activate it after it has been in "monitor" mode for a short while that I
considered enough to learn if it would have an undesired impact in the cluster.

As a Kubernetes administrator I want to plot in Grafana acceptions/rejections/mutations coming from
policies in "monitor" mode in the same way that I do with policies in "protect" mode -- the only mode
Kubewarden had until now.

## "monitor" mode

### CRD

The `ClusterAdmissionPolicy` CRD will be extended so it includes a `mode` attribute:

```go
type ClusterAdmissionPolicySpec struct {
   // ...
   Mode string `json:"mode,omitempty"`
   // ...
}
```

Two values are allowed: `protect` and `monitor`. If `mode` is omitted,
it will be defaulted to `protect`.

It's possible to update the `mode` from `monitor` to `protect`.

Allowing to change `mode` from `protect` to `monitor` will be rejected
-- so it's not possible to deactivate policies just by having `UPDATE`
permissions. If the user wants to change a policy from `protect` to
`monitor` mode, they have to delete the policy and recreate in `monitor`
mode as a new policy, so it's clear that the user needs `DELETE`
permission over the policy resource.

### Policy Server

The Policy Server has to be updated so the `mode` is included in the [`Policy` struct used for
settings](https://github.com/kubewarden/policy-server/blob/c8d64da87448b7f9250a1d6b5e56817f25b56359/src/settings.rs#L11-L19).

The Policy Server will always accept the request if this struct `mode` is set to `monitor`.

The Policy Server will log with INFO level every evaluation specifying the `mode` of the policy. If
the policy is mutating the resource, the resulting object will be printed in the structured tracing
output.

#### Metrics

Add `mode` to the existing `PolicyEvaluation` metric baggage.
